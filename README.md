# Savings Goal Tracker

The **Savings Goal Tracker** is a simple Python program that helps users calculate how long it will take to reach their savings goal. The user enters their total goal, current savings, and planned weekly contributions. The program then performs the math and displays how many weeks are needed and what percentage of the goal has already been achieved. This project demonstrates Python basics such as user input, numeric conversion, calculations, formatted output, and error handling.

## How to Run the Program

1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project folder.
3. Run the program using:

python app.py
# or
python3 app.py
